# 🍔 FoodieDash: Login & Signup Authentication UI

This repository contains the front-end code for a modern, responsive Login and Account Creation UI/UX designed for a food delivery platform, "FoodieDash."

This project was built as a focused exercise on **HTML structure, professional CSS styling, and responsive design**.

## ✨ Features

* **Dual Authentication Tabs:** Seamless switching between "Sign in" and "Create account" forms using JavaScript.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** Utilizes a bright, high-contrast color palette (`#ff9a3c` and `#ff3c68`) with subtle gradients and box-shadows.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized using CSS Grid for larger screens and collapses gracefully to a single column for mobile view (`@media (max-width: 800px)`).
* **Clear UX:** Features dedicated input fields, validation hints, and quick links (Forgot Password, Social Sign-in).
* **Marketing Panel:** Includes a separate hero panel with metrics and visual elements to enhance conversion and user trust.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animation effects.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** For simple UI logic (switching active forms/tabs).

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    ```
2.  **Open the file:** Navigate to the cloned folder and open `index.html` directly in your web browser.

## 💡 Learning & Next Steps

This project focused heavily on styling and client-side usability. Future improvements or advanced versions could include:

* **Form Validation:** Adding client-side JavaScript validation for fields (e.g., email format, password strength).
* **Backend Integration:** Connecting the forms to a simple backend (e.g., using **Spring Boot** or **Flask**) to handle user authentication.
* **Accessibility:** Enhancing ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
